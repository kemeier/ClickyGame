Clicky Game is a React application that uses Create React App.
It renders different images to the screen, and each image listens for click events.

The application also keeps track of the user's score, which is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time the user clicks an image, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in random order. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
